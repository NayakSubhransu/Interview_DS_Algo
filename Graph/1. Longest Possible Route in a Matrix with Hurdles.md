Given an N x M matrix, with a few hurdles(denoted by 0) arbitrarily placed, calculate the length of the longest possible route possible from source(xs,ys) to a destination(xd,yd) within the matrix. We are allowed to move to only adjacent cells which are not hurdles. The route cannot contain any diagonal moves and a location once visited in a particular path cannot be visited again.If it is impossible to reach the destination from the source return -1.
